# BellyButton
JavaScript, HTML, HTTP, Python, Plotly

### Purpose
The purpose of the BellyButton Module is to set up the abilitiy to identify the top 10 bacterial species in each subject's belly buttons. That way, if Improbable Beef identifies a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, the subjects will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.

### Deliverable 1: Create a Horizontal Bar Chart of the top 10 Bacterias found in the belly buttons.
This deliverable's purpose was to identify the most common bacterias found in order to narrow down what bacteria is most useful for the improbable beef company.

### Deliverable 2: Create a Bubble Chart
This deliverable is to be able to show the different proportions of bacterias and how frequently they were found in each sample. This gives a better visualizationn than the bar chart due to the difference in sizes based on count. This is for how many different bacterias are found in each sample.

### Deliverable 3: The Gauge Chart
This deliverable measures the washing rate each week per subject and where they fall in comparison to others. This has to do with the different bacterias that are found in each subject while comparing them to how frequently they wash their belly buttons in a week.

### Application
The final application is used in order for each subject to be able to locate their test subject number and then display the results that are particular to their specific belly button. This allows the volunteers to understand what bacterias are found in their navel, how much of each bacteria is found in their navel, and where they are on the spectrum of frequecy of washes.
